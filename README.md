# Integration SDK Examples

This repo provides Appian partners with examples of how to create Connected System Plug-ins and Component Plug-ins.

## Connected System Plug-in (CSP) SDK
The Connected System Plug-in (CSP) SDK gives developers a toolkit for providing designers with simple, point-click integration experiences. With the SDK, developers can create Connected System Plug-ins that appear alongside out-of-the-box Connected Systems like Google Cloud Natural Language or Amazon Machine Learning in the Appian Designer UI.

## Component Plug-in (CP) and Client API
The Client API in the CSP SDK enables developers to build more complex Component Plug-ins with the support of server-side, java-based Client APIs. These Client APIs have access to the configurations stored in their parent Connected System.
